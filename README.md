# **Python Course v1.0**

## 6 Weeks to create a fully functional toolbox!

What you will learn throughout this course is how to perform basic python operations, and understand the basics of design, and implementation. 

On course completion, you will have a fully operational toolbox that you can run from virtually any command line. Even a phone!

Each week we will cover a range of topics that build upon eachother. Every week for the next 6 weeks on Wednesdays, and Saturdays, we will add to our toolbox. 
On each Sunday, the next weeks agenda will be updated. If you feel that you can't make it, or don't want to be present for the next weeks project, please let @Mutim know in advanced. 

This is designed to get you basically familiar with GitHub, and Python.
